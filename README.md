A license plate number is a unique identifier of a vehicle and its owner. This project involves the development of an ANPR system for gate control and vehicle monitoring. The system uses Raspberry Pi, OpenCV and camera to capture images of vehicles, detect license plates, and extract the alphanumeric characters. Built for real-time operation, it utilizes a trained YOLOv7 model for accurate license plate detection and EasyOCR for character recognition. This cost-effective ANPR system holds promise for various applications such as gate control and access management, traffic monitoring, and aiding law enforcement in identifying stolen vehicles.
